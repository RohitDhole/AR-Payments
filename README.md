# AR-Payments


The purpose of this project is to create a way for items with a UPC (commonly found in most retail stores) to be identified via camera on an augmented reality capable device. Along with product identification and background information and description about the product, an option to pay for the product will be given. When this pay option is selected, the payment methods from the user's device/phone will be used ot make an online authenticated payment for that item, with an email sent to the user as proof of sale. The main practical use of this application would be to minimize line size at checkout and to help copmanies move forward in this technologically advancing world.
